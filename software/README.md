# Codes

* Each model + dataset pair is run in a seperate notebook, hence there are a total of 7 notebooks. Each notebook runs the baseline, weight decay and 5 augmentations. 

* To run each notebook on colab make sure to upload the dataset onto your google drive and alter the path appropriately. 

## FOR PAMP Related Files

* Load pamap_scaled2.h5 file after running the first cell in notebook to mount onto Google drive
* No need to download dataset separately (Pick the necessary Apt Aug Function to run)
